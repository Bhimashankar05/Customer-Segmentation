# Customer-Segmentation

I analyzed a dataset related to customer segmentation and performed the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed the dataset structure, data types, and identified missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data and ensured the dataset was properly formatted for analysis.  
3. **Statistical Insights**: Calculated key metrics, such as average spending, frequency, and demographic distributions, and performed grouped analyses (e.g., segment performance by product preferences).  
4. **Clustering**: Applied clustering models (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences.  
5. **Visualization**: Used visual tools to explore segment distributions, identify trends, and analyze relationships between customer groups and product/service preferences.  
6. **Documentation**: Compiled findings for clarity, ensuring they are reproducible and ready for sharing on Kaggle or GitHub.
